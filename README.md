# Image Processing Basics in MATLAB

This project demonstrates basic image processing operations in MATLAB, including contrast enhancement, grayscale conversion, downsampling, upsampling, quantization, binarization, and custom 2D convolution.

## Features

- Contrast enhancement using `imadjust`
- RGB to Grayscale conversion
- Downsampling & bicubic upsampling
- Image quantization (4/8/16/32 levels)
- Image differencing
- Binarization
- Custom convolution in horizontal and vertical directions

## Preview

Operations include:
- Original vs Enhanced
- Quantized versions
- Convolution output

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2018b or later
- Image Processing Toolbox
